Hello!!!
This is a test.
Lets see how far I have come.

Some unix commands that are usefull (used in PS):
mkdir name  -> create a folder in the current map
mkdir C:\lkjsdf\KSJDf\KSJDF name   -> create a folder in a subdirectory/map you are not in yet

ls  -> list the folders within the directory you are in
cd name map in the list (example alfabet)  -> change to another directory

cd ..  -> goes to the previous directory

rm name -> remove a file with that name
rm c:\SDKJF\JHXf\DS name ->remove file with a name from a directory you are not currently in
